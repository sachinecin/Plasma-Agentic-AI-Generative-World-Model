# Plasma-Agentic-AI-Generative-World-Model
 next-gen evolution of Agent Lightning that replaces heavy RL training with Phantom-Path Simulations and LoRA Distillation. It uses a generative "World Model" to practice tasks in a sandbox, deploying tiny "instruction packets" for real-time edge adaptation. It features visual error-learning and adversarial auditing to prevent reward hacking.
